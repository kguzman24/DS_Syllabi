Syllabus 

The course will introduce students to the data scientist toolkit and the underlying core concepts. It will cover the full technical pipeline from data collection (sampling methods, crawling) to processing and basic notions of statistical analysis and 

visualization. The module will also include advanced topics in high-performance computing, including non-relational databases and MapReduce. By taking this course the students will be provided with the basic toolkit to work with data (CSV, R, MongoDB). To support these learning objectives, the coursework will include 

exercises and a group project in which 

students will use existing open data sets 

and build their own application. 

The course will cover the following concepts: 

Fundamentals and core terminology 

Technology pipeline and methods 

Application scenarios and state of the art 

Data collection (sampling, crawling) 

Data analytics (statistical modeling, basic concepts, experiment design, pitfalls, R)
