pj Grading 

Your mastery of course content is assessed using a  variety of methods:  

Assignments 40%  

Weekly Quizzes 20%  

Group Discussions 15%  

Final Project 25%  

TOTAL 100%  

Final grades are assigned using the following scale:  

90-100% A  

80-89% B  

60-79% C  

0-59% F  

• You can see a detailed list of all quizzes, assignments, and group project deadlines in the Course Calendar section. 

• Quizzes: Most weeks include a quiz of 25-30 questions covering that week's course content, readings, and videos, The quizzes are generally available on Monday and must be taken no later than 11 :59 p.m. Sunday. All quizzes are timed, and you are allowed only one attempt, so please do not attempt the quiz until you have thoroughly worked through the week's material. The quizzes are graded automatically, so you should receive your score immediately, 

• Assignments: Assignments also cover the course content, readings, and videos, and are generally posted every two to three weeks. 

• Discussions: Discussions are your opportunity to contribute from and learn from your peers. We will engage in several discussions throughout the semester, as outlined in the Course Calendar. Note that every assessed discussion requires two posts: one for your original contribution to the discussion's central issues and at least two responses to your peers, The deadlines for these are staggered so everyone has a chance to post and respond, Your initial post counts as 75% of each discussion grade, while your replies count for the remaining 25%. In order to create a professional, open communication environment, you are expected to follow these on line discussion guidelines (lcontenVds/700Ma171sec01/81_01_Rubrics  /Discussion_ Guldefines.pdf? _&d2ISessionVa!=MHlxQXEUQR86L!OibfZ501 lpJ&ou=3886038).

Course Syllabus  

• Late Submissions (Assignments, Discussions): You are expected to submit all evaluated work (including assignments and graded discussions) on or prior to the due date. Work submitted after the due date will be accepted and will receive partial credit. The instructor reserves_ the right to subtract up to 5% per day late from the final score. 

• Grading Turnaround Time (Assignments, Discussions): Your instructor will finish grading assignments and discussion posts no later than two weeks after submission. 

A Policies & Procedures  

Feedback & Communication  

The instructor will provide individual feedback to help with the learning process. The instructor also encourages  your feedback regarding the course content and delivery to ensure you understand the material. The instructor  may also seek your feedback through surveys.  

The instructor will try to respond to all student email within 24 hours.  

This course uses two kinds of discussions:  

• All general, non-graded discussions are conducted through Piazza, an on line Q&A tool (ld2l/common/dialogs  tquicklinklquicklink.d2I?ou=3BB603B&type=content&rcode=UWS1-12052447) that allows you to communicate with your peers and instructors across multiple sections of this course. This is a great place to ask about course logistics, request assignment clarifications, or even just share useful data science resources you have found. 

• Graded discussions that are part of your required coursework (described previously in this syllabus) are conducted here in the online course. To find these, click the Discussions link at the top of the page. 

Staying Current  

The instructor reserves the right to make appropriate changes to the course schedule and course content at any  time during the course. Often these changes are influenced by your feedback and experience and are designed to  better target key skills and enhance your education.  

You are strongly advised to check the learning management system several times a week to make sure all  readings, assignments, and quizzes are completed on time.  

Incomplete Grades  

lncompletes are given only in unusual and extreme cases.  

Academic Integrity  

You are expected to maintain high standards of ethical conduct and academic integrity during the course. Any  student found to have committed acts of academic dishonesty such as cheating, plagiarizing, copying from other  students, allowing others to copy from you, copying from the Internet, and disrupting the class may result in  disciplinary action including a failing grade.  

Accessibility Accomodations  

Students with documented disabilities have the right to request information and necessary accommodations from  their University, as stipulated within Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act and the Americans with Disabilities Act.  Students interested in requesting academic accommodations must contact the Accessibility Services office at  their home campus to begin the application process. Please be advised that the eligibility determination process  and, once approved, implementation of accommodation services could take several weeks. It is important for  students to be proactive and initiate the process early in order to ensure that accommodations are in place by the  time they will be needed.
