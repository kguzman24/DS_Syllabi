Syllabus 

This course gives in depth introduction to statistics and machine learning theory, methods, and algorithms for data science. It covers 

multiple regression, kernel learning, sparse regression, sure screening, generalized linear models and quasi-likelihood, covariance 

learning and factor models, principal component analysis, supervised and unsupervised learning, deep learning, and other related topics 

such as community detection, item ranking, and matrix completion. Applicability and limitations of these methods will be illustrated 

using mathematical statistics and a variety of modern real world data sets and manipulation of the statistical software R. 

Course material will be covered the following topics; some topics will be assigned as reading materials.

Computation 

The software package for this class is R (https://www.r-project.org/), or RStudio (https://rstudio.com/). See R-labs below. Most of 

computation in this class can be done through a laptop. Laptops with wireless communication off can be used during the exams, and 

so are the calculators. 

Attendance 

Attendance of the class is required and essential. The course materials are mainly from the notes. Many conceptual issues and 

statistical thinking are only taught in the class. They will appear in the midterm and final exams. 

Homework 

Problems will be assigned through Canvas (https://canvas.princeton.edu/) approximately biweekly and submitted online. No late 

homework will be accepted. Missed homework will receive a grade of zero. The homework will be graded, and each assignment carries 

equal weight. You are allowed to work with other students on the homework problems, however, verbatim copying of homework is 

absolutely forbidden. Therefore each student must ultimately produce his or her own homework to be handed in and graded. 

Exams 

There will be one in-class midterm exam, and a final exam. All exams are required and there will be no make-up exams. Missed exams 

will receive a grade of zero. All exams are open-book and open-notes. Laptops with wireless off and calculators may be used during the 

exams.
