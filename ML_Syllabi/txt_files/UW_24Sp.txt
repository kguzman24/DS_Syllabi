Info
This is a rough sketch of the quarter and things are subject to change. We can accurately predict the past, but
predicting the future is hard!
Lessons
Anything listed in the “Lesson” materials for a day should be done before attending class that day. We recommend
doing all the slides before the “Pause and Think” slide. Each class session will start by reviewing what was in the
Lesson and then most time will be spent on working on practice problems in the Lessons. See the syllabus for more
info!

Module 0 - Introduction / Regression
Wed
03/27
LES 00 Regression
Note: Normally there is are pre-class materials that you should complete before
attending class. For the first day there are none! You should complete the Checkpoint
after class (due before the next class). 
Note (2): The CSE/STAT 416 Training links for today are extremely useful resources
to make sure you are prepared for the class. The course will be in Python, so
Resources 1 and 2 will be very helpful if you are less familiar with the language.
Resource 3 covers the mathematical background we expect students to be
comfortable with in the course. You are expected to complete these trainings, but they
are not factored into your grade. We encourage you to work on them now before
assignments are released.

Note: This is a draft book for the course. It is still a work in progress so it
will still have some errors and TODOs left throughout. Feedback is welcome
and encouraged!

Note: These notes are from a different offering of the course and may use
slightly different notation and terminology.

Note: The Elements of Statistical Learning [ESL] is an advanced machine
learning textbook that we link to as optional readings for students who want
to learn more of the nitty-gritty details behind the model's derivations. You
do not need to understand readings labeled as "Optional"
