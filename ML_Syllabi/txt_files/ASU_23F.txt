Class routine
Flipped classroom: This course uses a “flipped classroom” format in which course
material is reviewed by the student independently prior to class, and in-class time is
dedicated to discussion, inquiry, application, and assessment of the topics reviewed
prior to class.
Class structure: The course consists of 5 units, with each unit containing 3-5 modules
(most contain 4 modules). Each module is associated with one in-class session.
●
Prior to the in-class session: The student must complete online lectures,
reading, and exercises for that module on Zybooks.
●
First 15 minutes (4:30-4:45pm): The instructor will give a short presentation
which may consist of a review of the module topic, contextualization of the
module topic in research or real-world applications, guest lecture/interview, or
other short activity.
●
Next 30 minutes (4:45-5:15pm): During the next 30 minutes of the in-class
session, students will be issued a review sheet via Canvas covering major topics.
Some class periods will also have an ICE to be completed during this time.
Students can work individually or in small groups to complete the questions on
the review sheet and ICE. The review sheet is not graded, but the ICE is graded.
The instructor and TA will be available to help answer questions.
●
Remaining 30 minutes (5:15-5:45pm): All students must individually complete a
quiz for the module, for which they have 30 minutes to complete. The quiz is
graded and can only be taken once.
●
Workshop classes: Unit 3 and Unit 4 contain a “Workshop Module” on the class
session before the exam is administered (October 16 for Unit 3 and November 6
for Unit 4). The Workshops will be TA-led and are designed to allow students to
ask questions about the lab or upcoming examination (that are both due in the
following session). There are no graded assignments during the Workshop
Module.
Key dates and deadlines
Zybooks module completion (readings, videos, exercises, etc.) are due by the start
of class on the day of class for that module (e.g., Module 1 should be completed by
4:30pm on August 23, 2023 and Module 18 should be completed by 4:30pm on
November 20, 2023). All times are in the Arizona time zone.
Module quizzes will open after the first 45 minutes of class (5:15pm) and are due at the
end of each class (5:45pm).
Unit exams will open at the start of the class period and are due at the end of the class
period (5:45pm) on the day they are administered.

Grade appeals
Any grade appeal must happen within 24 hours of the grade’s posting. Later appeal will
not be considered. Grade appeals must be sent by Canvas mail. If an automatically
graded assignment (other than labs or re-grades announced by the instructional team)
does not post within 24 hours of completion, the student should assume the assignment
was scored a zero and should contact the instructional team with any discrepancy.
Grade changes will only be made if there is an error in assignment grading. No
grade changes will be made based on student requests for rounding, alternate
interpretations of assignments, or any other reason.
Lecture notes and course materials
Lecture notes will be available via ASU Canvas and Zybooks. The notes will be posted
before each lecture. All contents of these lectures, including notes and assignments
distributed to the class, are under copyright protection. They may not be redistributed,
sold or commercialized without the express permission of the instructor. In other
words, you may not post the course materials on CourseHero, share them with
other students, or any other re-distribution of the material.
Copyright policy
Course content, including lectures, are copyrighted materials and students may not
share outside the class, upload to online websites not approved by the instructor, sell, or
distribute course content or notes taken during the conduct of the course (see ACD
304–06, “Commercial Note Taking Services ” and ABOR Policy 5-308 F.14 for more).
Students may not upload or submit any material that is not the student's original work,
unless the students comply with all applicable copyright laws; faculty members reserve
the right to delete materials on the grounds of suspected copyright infringement.

NO SPECIAL EXCEPTIONS ARE GRANTED TO THE POLICIES OF THIS SYLLABUS
Absences and late or missed assignments
Graded events for which a student is not present will be scored as zero. Any
assignment not submitted by the due date/time will be scored zero. In extreme cases,
there may be special approvals. As most of the graded events are already built with
maximum flexibility already in mind, the approval standards differ by graded assignment
– and will only be considered in the cases of quizzes or exams.
●
Syllabus quiz: The syllabus quiz will be issued on the first day of instruction. If
you cannot attend the first day of instruction, please contact the TA team prior to
the first day of class. Appropriate documentation must be provided for approval.
●
Module readings, videos, and exercises (Zybooks): Since all Zybooks
materials will be available starting on the first day of the course, there will be no
extension granted to the due date for any module reading, video, exercise group.
●
In-Class Exercises (ICE’s): If a student misses class, they may complete the
ICE on their own. No extensions for ICE completion will be granted.
●
Module quizzes:
○
All students: The lowest two module quiz scores will be dropped and
replaced with a score of 15/15. This is designed to support students who
may miss in-class quizzes for excused reasons.
○
Students who miss 1 or 2 quizzes: No documentation is required (and
none will be accepted), as the missed quizzes will be the replaced scores.
○
Students who miss >2 quizzes: The student must provide documentation
for all excusable quiz absences. For excused quiz absences beyond 2
missed quizzes, a make-up or alternate event will be coordinated with the
TA. For example, if the student misses 3 quizzes, the student must provide
documentation for all 3 missed quizzes and will be required to coordinate
with the TA to take make-up for the missed quiz.
○
Unit Labs: Since all unit labs will be available starting on the first day of
the course, there will be no extension granted for any unit lab.
○
Unit Exams: All make-up/make-ahead coordination for unit exams must be
made with the TA. Documentation must be provided for all unit exam
make-up / make ahead.
Required documentation for Make-up/Make-ahead requests
In general, requests for make-up and make-ahead assignments will not be approved. In
extreme cases, for items in the previous section requiring an alternate event, students
must follow the below procedures for make-up or make-ahead requests.
If the student knows they will miss a graded event at least 72 hours prior to its
occurrence, they may be eligible for a make-ahead event.
●
Make-ahead events must be coordinated with the TA at least 72 hours prior
●
Required documentation must be submitted to the TA at least 72 hours prior
●
The TA may work with the student to schedule the make-ahead either before or
after the graded event occurs
●
All make-aheads must be approved by the instructor upon review of
documentation
9
NO SPECIAL EXCEPTIONS ARE GRANTED TO THE POLICIES OF THIS SYLLABUS
●
Make-aheads may be allowed for the following scenarios with required
documentation:
○
Excused absences related to religious observances/practices that are in
accord with ACD 304–04, “Accommodation for Religious Practices”
○
Excused absences related to university sanctioned events/activities that
are in accord with ACD 304–02, “Missed Classes Due to
University-Sanctioned Activities”
○
Excused absences related to missed class due to military line-of-duty
activities that are in accord with ACD 304–11
○
Funeral of an immediate family member: If you need to attend the funeral
of an immediate family member (defined as grand-parent, parent, spouse,
sibling or child), you need the instructor's prior approval. Proof is required.
In the case of an emergency situation where the student misses a class due to an
extreme situation, there may be a possibility of a make-up.
●
Make-up events must be coordinated with the TA no later than 24 hours following
the due-date/time of the event
●
Required documentation must be submitted to the TA no later than 24 hours the
due-date/time of the event
●
All make-ups must be approved by the instructor upon review of documentation
●
Make-ups may be allowed for the following scenarios with documentation:
○
Medical Problems: You need to submit a statement with the signature of
the doctor and the seal of the hospital saying that you were not able to be
in class at the specified time.
○
Travel Accident: You need to submit a police report stating that you are
involved in an accident and show a printout on “Google maps” to certify
that you could not arrive on-time for the graded event.
●
Note: medical emergencies/conditions may qualify for special considerations like
late withdrawal or incomplete grade, but do not automatically warrant a make-up.
Note on COVID-19 positive tests. Students who test positive for a COVID-19 variant
who are not hospitalized and capable of working must contact the TA team to ensure
they can complete in-class assignments from a remote, isolated location. Students who
test positive for COVID-19 are not permitted to attend in-person sessions.
Note on technology issues. End-user technology issues are not excuses for late or
missed assignments. It is the student’s responsibility to ensure all course work can be
completed including a back-up plan should your computer, internet connection, or other
technology fail. Students are recommended to backup all work using Github, a USB
drive, an external drive, or a cloud service such as Dropbox, Google Drive, or iCloud.
Electronic communication and email policy
All communication with the instructor, TA, IA, or grading team will be through Canvas.
The instructor, TA, and grading team will not respond to emails.
Please use the following order of operations for contacting the instructional team:
10
NO SPECIAL EXCEPTIONS ARE GRANTED TO THE POLICIES OF THIS SYLLABUS
1. Canvas Discussion Board: If you have a question that is not of a personal
nature, please post the question on the Discussion Board on Canvas. It’s likely
that another student has the same question, so you will be helping them and the
instructional team by posting your question here. Students are encouraged to
respond to the questions of their classmates. Prior to posting a question or
comment, check the syllabus, announcements, and existing posts to ensure it's
not redundant.
2. Attend office hours: If you have a question that cannot be answered through
the Discussion Board, attend office hours hosted by the instructional team.
3. Canvas Mail: If your communication cannot be addressed through the
discussion board or office hours, then you can send a message via Canvas to
the TA. The TA will directly answer your message, unless the TA feels that my
direct assistance is needed.
Additional notes about communication:
●
Communication will be reviewed once per day, Monday through Friday during
business hours (approximately 9am-5pm).
●
All communication must be directed to the TA.
●
Messages should be clear, self-contained, and to the point.
●
Messages should not ask questions whose answers are obviously shown in the
course syllabus, class notes/class materials, or other materials on Canvas.
●
Avoid asking questions in electronic communications that should be raised either
in class or in individual consultation with the TA during office hours. These
include questions of an excessively conceptual nature, and questions that require
an unreasonable amount of time from the instructor/TA.
●
A good rule of thumb: if your question cannot be answered in a short paragraph
(1-3 sentences), then it is not appropriate for electronic communication.
Academic integrity
Students in this class must adhere to ASU’s academic integrity policy, which can be
found at https://provost.asu.edu/academic-integrity/policy). Students are responsible
for reviewing this policy and understanding each of the areas in which academic
dishonesty can occur. In addition, all engineering students are expected to adhere to
the ASU Academic Integrity Honor Code. All academic integrity violations will be
reported to the Fulton Schools of Engineering Academic Integrity Office (AIO).
The AIO maintains a record of all violations and has access to academic integrity
violations committed in all other ASU colleges/schools.
Specific rules for this class are as follows. All assignments and projects must be your
own individual work unless specified as team efforts. You are encouraged to learn from
each other but copying is strongly discouraged. All solutions turned in for credit are to
be your individual work and should demonstrate your problem-solving skills. The
instructor reserves the right to question a student orally or in writing and to use their
evaluation of the student's understanding of the assignment and of the submitted
solution as evidence of cheating. Violators of this policy will be faced with severe
penalties, which may range from deducted points to failure of the course.

Harassment and Sexual Discrimination
Arizona State University is committed to providing an environment free of discrimination,
harassment, or retaliation for the entire university community, including all students,
faculty members, staff employees, and guests. ASU expressly prohibits discrimination,
harassment, and retaliation by employees, students, contractors, or agents of the
university based on any protected status: race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age,
disability, veteran status, sexual orientation, gender identity, and genetic information.
Title IX is a federal law that provides that no person be excluded on the basis of sex
from participation in, be denied benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any
education program or activity. Both Title IX and university policy make clear that sexual
violence and harassment based on sex is prohibited. An individual who believes they
have been subjected to sexual violence or harassed on the basis of sex can seek
support, including counseling and academic support, from the university. If you or
someone you know has been harassed on the basis of sex or sexually assaulted, you
can find information and resources at https://sexualviolenceprevention.asu.edu/faqs.
As a mandated reporter, I am obligated to report any information I become aware of
regarding alleged acts of sexual discrimination, including sexual violence and dating
violence. ASU Counseling Services, https://eoss.asu.edu/counseling is available if you
wish to discuss any concerns confidentially and privately. ASU online students may
access 360 Life Services, https://goto.asuonline.asu.edu/success/online-resources.html.
Disability accommodations
Suitable accommodations are made for students having disabilities. Students needing
accommodations must register with the ASU Disabilities Resource Center and provide
documentation of that registration to the instructor. Students should communicate the
need for an accommodation in enough time for it to be properly arranged. See ACD
304-08 Classroom and Testing Accommodations for Students with Disabilities.
Class behavior
Students, faculty, staff, and other individuals do not have an unqualified right of access
to university grounds, property, or services (see SSM 104-02). Interfering with the
peaceful conduct of university-related business or activities or remaining on campus
grounds after a request to leave may be considered a crime. All incidents and
allegations of violent or threatening conduct by an ASU student (whether on- or
off-campus) must be reported to the ASU Police Department (ASU PD) and the Office of
the Dean of Students.
Waiting for an absent instructor
In the event the instructor fails to indicate a time obligation, the time obligation will be 15
minutes for class sessions lasting 90 minutes or less, and 30 minutes for class sessions
lasting more than 90 minutes. Students may be directed to wait longer by someone from
the academic unit if they know the instructor will arrive shortly.
