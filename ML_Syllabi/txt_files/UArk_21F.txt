Face to Face Delivery Plan
         According to the university policy, all classes in this 
semester will be in-person. Students are expected to 
attend face-to-face lectures under normal conditions.
         Meanwhile, all lectures will be recorded within 
Blackboard for students who need to isolate or need to 
quarantine due to Covid-19 exposure to view.
         As the COVID-19 delta variant is increasing in our area, 
students can request in writing (i.e., email) not to attend a 
face-to-face lecture but view a recorded lecture, and I will 
decide whether to accommodate the request. If you would 
like to do so, please send an email directly to me for 
making this request. Please remember that I reserve the 
right to stop the viewing of recorded lectures and require 
face-to-face attendance at any time.
         According to the new policy, masks will be required in the 
classroom when at least 6-feet of social distancing can’t be 
maintained.
