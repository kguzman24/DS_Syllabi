INFO 103 Introduction to Data Science -  3 credit hours 

Online Section 

 

 

Term: Spring 2018 

Instructor: Jeremy Leipzig Contact: jnl47@drexel.edu 

 

 

Prerequisites 

None 

 

Curriculum role 

This course is a core course for the BSDS program, a required course for the BSDS Minor, and a course in the Department of Information Science’s common freshman year. 

 

Required texts 

There is no required textbook. This course is self-contained and open source; required readings include the course notes and any linked material labeled as “required.” All materials may be found linked from the course notes (leipzig.github.io/Intro2DS/) and from the index at the bottom of the syllabus. 

 

Description 

A first course in data science. Introduces data science as a field, describes the roles and services that various members of the community play and the life cycle of data science projects. Provides an overview of common types of data, where they come from, and the challenges that practitioners face in the modern world of “Big Data.” Provides an introduction to the interdisciplinary mixture of skills that the practice requires. 

 

This course was designed by Dr. Jake Williams – it was originally INFO 240. 

 

Rationale 

Individuals from a wide range of disciplines work with or alongside technology and will, at some point or another in their careers, encounter the effects that the increasing presence of electronic data is making on how business operates and decisions are made. This survey course is intended to provide students with base-level knowledge on the emerging field of data science. Students may then go on to more advanced study in data science, or carry general knowledge of it forward into their own disciplines. 

 

Learning outcomes 

Upon successful completion of this course, students will be able to: 

discuss the main concepts of data science; 

illustrate the types of problems that data analytics can approach; 

describe a variety of data types and storage formats; 

explain challenges with processing Big Data efficiently and effectively; 

identify the skills and capabilities needed by data scientists; • and interpret the key features of a complete data science project. 

 	 

Discussion 

The online section of the course will involve the participation in the Blackboard discussion board. Topics will be derived from the readings 

 

Demos 

There will be 8 programming demonstrations that will represent course concepts concretely in the context of the Python programming language. These demonstrations will be presented in class and are be read and interpreted, only. While programming is not a curricular requirement of this course, student understanding of the concepts and challenges illustrated in the programming demos will be assessed in the homework. 

 

Homework  

There will be two homework assignments to be completed individually. These will cover course readings and demos, will have two-week lifetimes, and are to be submitted electronically via Blackboard Learn no later than 11:59pm on the days due, with names, IDs, and the course and assignment numbers recorded in submission headers. 

 

If you are dissatisfied with a grade or point deduction, you can request re-marking. Re-marking requests must be done through written (paper or email) descriptions of why you think the grade is in error. If you wish to appeal a course grade, school policies apply. 

 

Mid-term exam 

There will be one mid-term exam on week 6, conducted in Blackboard. There is no final exam. 

 

Group project 

There will be a project to be completed by groups of size 3 (or 4, depending on class size), whose milestones will consist of a written description, due on the Friday of week 8, and a presentation to be conducted as a video or a voiceover slide deck in week 10. There is no final exam. 

 

Grading 

Course grades will be based on Blackboard discussion participation (25%),  two homework assignments (25%), one exam (20%), and a group project’s written description (15%) and presentation (15%):

Disabilities 

Students requesting accommodations due to a disability at Drexel University need to present a current Accommodation Verification Letter (AVL) to faculty before accommodations can be made. AVL’s are issued by the Office of Disability Resources (ODR). For additional information, visit the ODR website at http://www.drexel.edu/oed/disabilityResources, or contact the Office for more information: 215-895-1401 (V), or disability@drexel.edu. 

 

Withdrawal of the Course 

For dropping or withdrawing from the course, please refer to the university policies at: 

 

http://www.drexel.edu/provost/policies/course-add-drop/ 

http://www.drexel.edu/provost/policies/course-withdrawal/ 

 

 

Class Lecture Recording 

Lectures may be rebroadcast for educational purposes only. 

 

Incomplete Policy 

Incomplete grades are contingent upon instructor approval and will only be considered in extenuating circumstances beyond the student’s control. The instructor is under no obligation to offer an incomplete grade. At least 80% of the graded coursework must have already been completed in order for an incomplete grade to be considered (per the recommendation of the Provost’s Office). An incomplete contract with an instructor-determined due date for delivery of the completed work must be completed by the student and the instructor. It can be found here: 

http://www.drexel.edu/provost/policies/pdf/forms/incomplete.pdf. 

 

Support for Equality and Diversity 

Drexel University strives to promote an environment of equality of opportunity and compliance with University policies and federal, state and local laws prohibiting discrimination based upon race, color, religion, gender (sex), marital status, pregnancy, national origin, age, disability and veteran status. Students, faculty, and staff with questions about or complaints concerning discrimination, harassment, and/or retaliation should contact the Office of Equality and Diversity at (215) 895-1403 or http://www.drexel.edu/oed/ 

 

Student Conduct and Community Standards 

Drexel University expects that all students as well as student organizations will conduct themselves responsibly and in a manner that reflects favorably upon themselves and the University. Check out here: http://www.drexel.edu/studentlife/community_standards/overview/ for the university policies, rules, regulations, and standards of conduct.  

 

Academic Honesty 

The Drexel University Academic Honesty Rules and Procedures (as stated in the student handbook) will be adhered to strictly.  Students who commit plagiarism or cheat on assignments may receive an F grade for both the assignment and the course. 

 

In order to avoid plagiarizing material, observe the following: 

If you work on an assignment with another student or a group of students, be certain that your final, individual paper is your own work or the work of your project group (for group projects) unless otherwise specified by the professor.  While you might want to discuss the assignment with other students, you must, in your paper, express your own ideas in your own way. 

If you use printed or electronic resources in your papers, be sure to attribute the sources you have used.  This can be done by quoting the material or by paraphrasing the material and, in either case, listing the source in an annotated bibliography.  Use standard notation when citing references. 

 

The college is requiring students to append a statement to deliverables (for example: papers, projects, exams) indicating that the work submitted is their own.  Deliverables will not be graded without a separate certification page.  

 

Please sign the following academic honesty statements by typing your name and date, and submit it through the Blackboard system as an individual assignment.  ======================================================= 

I certify that my work in this course will be entirely my own work. I will not quote the words of any other person from a printed source or a website without indicating what has been quoted and providing an appropriate citation. I will not submit my work in this course to satisfy the requirements of any other course.
