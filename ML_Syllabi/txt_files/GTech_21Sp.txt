Course Overview
This course introduces techniques in machine learning with an emphasis on algorithms and their applications to real-
world data. We will investigate the following question: how to computationally extract useful knowledge from data for
decision making and task support? We will focus on machine learning methods, which are organized into three parts:
1. Basic math for data science and machine learning
Linear algebra
Probability and statistics
Information theory
Optimization
2. Unsupervised machine learning for data exploration
Clustering analysis
Dimensionality reduction
Kernel density estimation
3. Supervised learning for predictive data analysis
Tree-based models
Support vector machines
Linear classification and regression
Neural networks
Prerequisites for this course include (1) basic knowledge of probability, statistics, and linear algebra; (2) Basic
programming experience in Python.
In addition to the technical content, this class includes the following learning objectives:
Structuring a task into a machine learning work flow
Collaborating effectively on team projects in a remote environment
Conducting peer evaluation in a constructive format
Communicating technical content in a concise and effective manner

Course policies
Attendance: Our class will be offered in an Asynch mode. We will not meet in person and every lecture will be
live-streamed and recorded. The recordings will be made available to all students after class time. My on-campus
class was mandatory and it helped me and my students A LOT to work with each other for a better environment to
facilitate learning. The class is in Asynch mode. Therefore, attendance is not required for this class, but I highly
recommend students to come to the live-streaming lectures. Trust me it will be fun and you will give me a lot of
energy to teach better. The fact that you need to listen to the lectures without fast-forwarding me can help you to
learn the materials much better and you will have the chance to ask questions if you are confused anywhere in the
lectures.
Class deliverables: All class deliverables will be handled via Gradescope excep quizzes which will be on Canvas.
The time span offered to complete the course objectives is plentiful and deadlines will not be extended under any
circumstances. To ensure the class is fair for all students, you will receive zero credit for work submitted after the
deadline. Regrade requests should be submitted directly on Gradescope within one week of grade publication.
Should you find yourself in an impasse with the TA responsible for your grading, feel free to contact the head TA or
course instructor.
Piazza:
Piazza will be the main and only place for the course discussions and announcements. If you have questions,
please ask it on Piazza first because 1) other students may have the same question; 2) you will get help much
faster.
If it’s something you do not like to discuss publicly on Piazza, you can use private messaging on Piazza.
Anytime you want to send a private message to just me on Piazza, please make sure to add our HEAD TAs too
in case I may miss your message.
Piazza GOOD questions
I don't understand this part of the lecture, can you explain it to me?
This certain part of the hw is not clear to me, would it be possible to explain that more?
I have a question about the project ...
I found an issue on the website, hw or the lectures, can you clarify ...
Any feedback, suggestions, ... would be greatly appreciated.
Usually, most of the questions are good.
Piazza BAD questions
Can you debug my code? [our team will not do that. You need to be specific about your question]
Can you find where the problem is in my code?
Exceptional circumstances: Any request for exceptions to these policies should be made in advance when at all
possible. Requests should be due to incapacitating illness, personal emergencies, or similarly serious events. Your
request should be accompanied by a supporting letter issued by the Dean of Students.
Diversity and inclusion
Just as machine learning algorithms cannot accomplish complex tasks if trained on datasets of limited variability, our
course cannot be successful without appreciating the diversity of our students. In this class we aim to create an
environment where all voices are valued, respecting the diversity of gender, sexuality, age, socioeconomic status,
ability, ethnicity, race, and culture. We always welcome suggestions that can help us achieve this goal. Additionally, if
any of our class scheduled activities conflicts with religious events, please inform the instruction team so that we can
make appropriate arrangements for you.
Students with disabilities: your access to this course is extremely important to us. The institute has policies
regarding disability accommodation, which are administered through the Office of Disability Services:
http://disabilityservices.gatech.edu. Please request your accommodation letter as early in the semester as possible, so
that we have adequate time to arrange your approved academic accommodations.
Office hours and questions
Office hours will start on the second week of clases. Please follow the instruction on this Excel Sheet [Undergrad]
[Grad] to signup for a 10-minutes slot with one of the TAs. If you require more than ten minutes, please advise the TAs.
They’ll return to your BlueJeans meeting once they have completed their appointments with other students. You just
need to add your name, question of interest and your BlueJeans meeting link. Please do not change the other part of the
Excel Sheet [Undergrad] [Grad]. The TA meetings are designed to be one-on-one. Please do not join another student’s
BlueJeans meeting. The sole exception to this policy being discussions about the project, in which your fellow team
members can also join. In addition to the one-on-one meetings open office hours with the instructor will be held weekly
where you can ask general questions about the topics covered in class. In-person office hours are only available by
appointment and will likely be held outdoors, in line with the aforementioned Georgia Tech's and CDC guidelines with
respect to preventing the spread of the coronavirus.

Grading
Assignments (50%)
There will be four assignments. Each one is designed to improve and test your understanding of the materials.
Assignments will have both programming and written analysis components.
You will need to submit all your assignments using Gradescope. Instructions on how to submit your code and
written portions will follow with every assignment. Handwritten solutions WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED and
you will not receive credit for a handwritten submission.
You are required to use Markdown, Latex (watch the tutorial created by our own team [Undergrad Access]
[Grad Access] and OverLeaf Latex Example in the Video), or a word processing software to generate your
solutions to the written questions. Because handwritten solutions WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED.
All assignments follow the “no-late” policy. Assignments received after the due date and time will receive zero
credit.
All students are expected to follow the Georgia Tech Academic Honor Code.
You can easily export your Jupyter Notebook to a Python file and import that to your desired python IDE to
debug your code for assignments.
You are NOT allowed to share any assignment codes or answers with other students. Piazza is the best
place to have discussion regarding assignments and course topics. Discussions are just for the better
understanding of questions and should not directly answer the questions.
We have 4 big assignments in total. Visit this course's Canvas site for the assignment documents. See the
schedule table above for deliverable due dates. (Topics are subject to change)
[12.5%] HW1: Linear Algebra, Probability and Statistics, Maximum Likelihood Estimation, Optimization,
Information Theory
[12.5%] HW2: KMeans, Expectation Maximization, Gaussian Mixture Model, Clustering Evaluation
HW3: Singular Value Decomposition, Principal Component Analysis, Linear Regression, Rgularization
Naive Bayes
[12.5%] HW4: Decision Trees, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, Neural Networks, CNN
Project (30%)
Proposal (5%)
A project proposal should be written on your GitHub page. It is also a good starter to come up with the
first draft of your project.
You need to provide us the link to your GitHub page. Make sure your GitHub repository is private.
It should be less than 500 words single spaced. References are not the part of the word count.
A project proposal should include:
Introduction/Background
Problem definition
Methods
Potential results
Discussion
At least three references (preferably peer reviewed). You need to properly cite the references on
your proposal.
A checkpoint to make sure you are working on a proper machine learning related project.
Your group needs to submit a presentation of your proposal. Please provide us a public link which
includes a 3 minutes recorded video. I found that OBS Studio and GT subscribed Kaltura are good tools
to record your screen. Please make your visuals are clearly visible in your video presentation.
Midterm report (10%)
A checkpoint to make sure that you have had major progress in your project. You will add information to
your project Proposal and turn it into your midterm report.
You need to provide us the link to your GitHub page. Make sure your GitHub repository is private.
The midterm report does not have a word count limitation.
A project midterm report is quite similar to your proposal with the exception of having actual results
instead of potential ones:
Introduction/Background
Problem definition
Data Collection
Methods
Results
Discussion
We need to see where you obtain your data and how you have done your data cleaning. Make sure to talk
about the features and different feature selection approaches.
You do not submit any video for the midterm report.
Final report (15%)
You need to provide us the link to your GitHub page. Make sure your GitHub repository is private.
A final report should include:
Introduction/Background
Problem definition
Data Collection
Methods
Results
Discussion
Conclusions
Your group needs to submit a presentation of your final report. Please provide us a public link which
includes a 6 to 9 minutes recorded video. I found that OBS Studio and GT subscribed Kaltura are good
tools to record your screen. Please make your visuals are clearly visible in your video presentation.
General project guidance
Your project will be graded based on the following criteria:
Was the motivation clear?
What is the problem?
Why is it important and why we should care?
Were the dataset and approach used effectively?
How did you get your dataset?
What are its characteristics (e.g. number of features, # of records, temporal or not, etc.)
Why do you think your approach can effectively solve your problem?
What is new in your approach?
Were the experiments, results, and conclusion satisfactory?
How did you evaluate your approach?
What are the results?
How do you compare your method to other methods?
How was the presentation in general?
Finished on time?
Effective visualizations? (Are they relevant? Do they help you better understand the project's
approaches and ideas?)
Use of text (Succinct or verbose?)
Undergrad students can ONLY team up with Undergrad Students, and Grad students can ONLY team
up with Grad students. If you are in a Grad students team, you are required to have both unsupervised
and supervised learning in your project. I highly recommend Undergrad students to use both
unsupervised and supervised learning in your project. However, if you were to pick one, please go with
supervised learning.
In order for you to obtain hands-on experience applying the topics covered in this course, you are
expected to complete a term project utilizing real-world data. The project will encompass both
unsupervised and supervised learning.
Each project needs to be completed in a team of five people (you will be forming your team on your own.
In case you cannot find a team, we will randomly assign you a team). Team members need to clearly
claim their contributions in the project report. Once your teams have been formed and you have selected
a topic, you will be assigned a mentor, who will provide you with general guidance on your project. It is
important to note that your team will lead the project effort: obtaining the data, researching data-driven
approaches to accomplish your project goal and coordinate your own activities. The role of the mentor is
solely to advise you, should you find yourself stuck and unable to make progress. We also accept a team
of four, if you really cannot find the fifth team member.
You will create a GitHub page page for your project, which you will use to publish your main
deliverables. There will be three deliverables published to your GitHub: a proposal, a midterm
checkpoint, and a final report.
Seminars: To help you conduct your project successfully, We have project seminars where one or two
TAs will present their research or industrial projects. Doing so, you will gain a good sense of what it is
being done in both Academia and Industry. Besides that, students can ask general questions about their
class project and how to improve that in each seminar. Seminars will be streamed online and recorded
and they will be published on the course website. Similar to the class lectures, Please ensure that you
join to these seminars and get yourself familiar with the practical and real-world application of ML. They
will be held on Wednesdays from 11:00 am to 12:00 pm. Timing may change for some of the seminars.
We will have Piazza post for each seminar, and its exact time. All the information will be updated for
each seminar on the course webiste with a BJ Event link.
Google colaboratory allows free access to run your Jupyter Notebook. I strongly suggest you use it for
your project, especially for teams that are going to employ Deep Learning. Don't forget to take advatage
of Google Cloud Platform and AWS Educate as well.
Quizzes (14%)
There will be 14 quizzes throughout the semester.
We will consider your top 9 quizzes' scores. Each quiz will have 1.55% of your final score.
All quizzes are mandatory to be taken even if they do not count toward your final grade.
The topic of each quiz will coincide roughly with the content covered in class on that week.
Quizzes will have a duration of seven-minutes for Undergrad students and six-minutes for Grad
students. Each quiz will have five multiple choice questions. They will be available from 12:00 am AOE
Monday until 11:59 pm AOE Monday.
Quizzes measure your understanding of the topics and they will be more conceptual questions.
Quizzes' answers will be released on Saturdays. Please do not ask any questions about a quiz that you just
take on Piazza before we release the answers.
Quizzes questions are selected randomly from our question bank, which means that students will not receive
the same questions for their quiz.
Class participation (6%)
Piazza has statistics which give us many measurements regarding how much a student has been involved on
Piazza's activities such as viewing posts, answering questions, asking questions and so on. We use this to
account for your Class Participation score. At the end of the semester, we will define a minimum and
maximum number of involvement considering all the students and your grade will be defined based on that.
Bonus points (up to 8%)
About bonus points: Bonus points will be counted to always be beneficial for your final grade. More
information on bonus points for assignments will be provided as the semester progresses. If it becomes
necessary to curve grades, bonus points will be applied after curving, not before.
Undergrad and grad: You can obtain up to 5% bonus points would be answering the challenging questions
we may have in some of the hws.
Undergrad: You will notice that we have bonus points for all the hws, where grad students are required to
answer those questions, but it will be optional for undergrad students. You will receive up to 3%, if you
answer those questions. Note that these are different than the challenging questions. Challenging questions
are bonus for both grad and undergrad.
How does it work? For example, hw 1 may have 30 bonus points, hw 2 may have 20 bonus points and so on.
If you receive all the bonus points for all your hws, we will add 5% to your final grade. If you are an undergrad
and you answer all the challenging and Grad students questions, you will receive 8%.
COVID-19 Policy
The fall semester 2020 is especially challenging due to the Covid-19 pandemic and a growing awareness of racial
inequities.  The following information relates to specific services and guidelines for courses during this semester.  The
most up-to-date information on Covid-19 is on the TECH Moving Forward website and in the Academic Restart
Frequently Asked Questions.  
Expectations and Guidelines
Each of us has a responsibility to ourselves and our fellow Yellow Jackets to be mindful of our shared commitment.
We are all required to wear a face covering while inside any campus facilities/buildings, including during in-person
classes, and to adhere to social distancing of at least 6 feet. If an individual forgets to bring a face covering to class
or into any indoor space, there will be a clearly marked supply of these in each building. If a student fails to follow
Georgia Tech’s policies on social distancing and face coverings, they will initially be reminded of the policy and if
necessary, asked to leave the class, meeting, or space. If they still fail to follow the policy, they may be referred to
the Office of the Dean of Students. Information on the Institute’s policy on face coverings.
Students are expected to sit in assigned seats and to come to class only on days that are assigned to them.
Papers, projects, tests, homework, and other assignments will only be accepted in electronic form unless the
assignment is a physical artifact.

During the fall 2020 semester, some faculty members may be required to quarantine due to exposure or isolate due to a
Covid-19 diagnosis. Some disruption to classes or services is inevitable, but Georgia Tech is making every effort to
ensure continuity of operations. As is the case in any semester, faculty may cancel a class if they have an illness or
emergency situation and cover any missed material at their own discretion. If an instructor needs to cancel a class, they
should notify students as early as possible.
Faculty who are staying home due to symptoms should monitor their health closely and consult with their school chair
to determine if remote instruction or substitute instruction is most appropriate for the course. If they need to cancel a
class repeatedly, a backup will be supplied in the form of a temporary substitute instructor or asynchronous work. No
course will be canceled after the first class has occurred.
If you have not tested positive but are ill or have been exposed to someone who is ill, please follow the Covid-19
Exposure Decision Tree for reporting your illness.
Student Illness or Exposure to Covid-19
During the semester, you may be required to quarantine or self-isolate to avoid the risk of infection to others.
 Quarantine is the separation of those who have been exposed to someone with Covid-19 but who are not ill; isolation is
the separation of those who have tested positive for Covid-19 or been diagnosed with Covid-19 by symptoms.
If you have not tested positive but are ill or have been exposed to someone who is ill, please follow the Covid-19
Exposure Decision Tree for reporting your illness.
During the quarantine or isolation period you may feel completely well, ill but able to work as usual, or too ill to work
until you recover.
Remote courses and remote class sessions during hybrid courses. Unless you are too ill to work, you should be able to
complete your remote work while in quarantine or isolation.
If you are ill and unable to do course work this will be treated similarly to any student illness. The Dean of Students will
have been contacted when you report your positive test or are told that it is necessary to quarantine and will notify your
instructor that you may be unable to attend class events or finish your work as the result of a health issue. Your
instructor will not be told the reason. We have asked all faculty to be lenient and understanding when setting work
deadlines or expecting students to finish work, and so you should be able to catch up with any work that you miss while
in quarantine or isolation. Your instructor may make available any video recordings of classes or slides that have been
used while you are absent, and may prepare some complementary asynchronous assignments that compensate for your
inability to participate in class sessions. Ask your instructor for the details.
CARE Center, Counseling Center, Stamps Health Services, and the Student Center
These uncertain times can be difficult, and many students may need help in dealing with stress and mental health.
The CARE Center and the Counseling Center, and Stamps Health Services will offer both in-person and virtual
appointments. Face-to-face appointments will require wearing a face covering and social distancing, with exceptions for
medical examinations. Student Center services and operations are available on the Student Center website. For more
information on these and other student services, contact the Vice President and Dean of Students or the Division of
Student Life.
Accommodations for Students at Higher Risk for Severe Illness with Covid-19
Students may request an accommodation through the Office of Disability Services (ODS) due to 1) presence of a
condition as defined by the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), or 2) identification as an individual of higher risk for
Covid-19, as defined by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC). Registering with ODS is a 3-step process that includes
completing an application, uploading documentation related to the accommodation request, and scheduling an
appointment for an “intake meeting” (either in person or via phone or video conference) with a disability coordinator.
 If you have been approved by ODS for an accommodation, I will work closely with you to understand your needs and
make a good faith effort to investigate whether or not requested accommodations are possible for this course. If the
accommodation request results in a fundamental alteration of the stated learning outcome of this course, ODS,
academic advisors, and the school offering the course will work with you to find a suitable alternative that as far as
possible preserves your progress toward graduation.
