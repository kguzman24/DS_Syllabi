Course Description 

Data Science is the study of the generalizable extraction of knowledge from data. Being a data scientist requires an integrated skill set spanning mathematics, statistics, machine learning, databases and other branches of computer science along with a good understanding of the craft of problem formulation to engineer effective solutions. This course will introduce students to this rapidly growing field and equip them with some of its basic principles and tools as well as its general mindset. Students will learn concepts, techniques and tools they need to deal with various facets of data science practice, including data collection and integration, exploratory data analysis, predictive modeling, descriptive modeling, data product creation, evaluation, and effective communication. The focus in the treatment of these topics will be on breadth, rather than depth, and emphasis will be placed on integration and synthesis of concepts and their application to solving problems. To make the learning contextual, real datasets from a variety of disciplines will be used. 

Learning outcomes 

At the conclusion of the course, students should be able to: 

• Describe what Data Science is and the skill sets needed to be a data scientist. 

Explain in basic terms what Statistical Inference means. Identify probability distributions commonly used 

as foundations for statistical modeling. Fit a model to data. 

• Use R to carry out basic statistical modeling and analysis. 

• 

Explain the significance of exploratory data analysis (EDA) in data science. Apply basic tools (plots, graphs, summary statistics) to carry out EDA. 

• Describe the Data Science Process and how its components interact. 

• Use APIs and other tools to scrap the Web and collect data. 

Apply EDA and the Data Science process in a case study. 

• Apply basic machine learning algorithms (Linear Regression, k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN), k-means, Naive Bayes) for predictive modeling. Explain why Linear Regression and k-NN are poor choices for Filtering Spam. Explain why Naive Bayes is a better alternative. 

Identify common approaches used for Feature Generation. Identify basic Feature Selection algorithms (Filters, Wrappers, Decision Trees, Random Forests) and use in applications. 

Identify and explain fundamental mathematical and algorithmic ingredients that constitute a 

Recommendation Engine (dimensionality reduction, singular value decomposition, principal competent 

analysis). Build their own recommendation system using existing components. 

• Create effective visualization of given data (to communicate or persuade). 

• Work effectively (and synergically) in teams on data science projects. 

• Reason around ethical and privacy issues in data science conduct and apply ethical practices. 

Audience 

The course is suitable for upper-level undergraduate (or graduate) students in computer science, computer engineering, electrical engineering, applied mathematics, business, computational sciences, and related analytic fields. 

Prerequisites 

Students are expected to have basic knowledge of algorithms and reasonable programming experience (equivalent to completing a data structures course such as CptS 223), and some familiarity with basic linear algebra (e.g. solution of linear systems and eigenvalue/vector computation) and basic probability and statistics. If you are interested in taking the course, but are not sure if you have the right background, talk to the instructor. You 

may still be allowed to take the course if you are willing to put in the extra effort to fill in any gaps. 

Course work 

The course consists of lectures (three times a week, 50 min each), and involves a set of assignments (about 3 or 4) and a project. A project could take one of several forms: analyzing an interesting dataset using existing methods and software tools; building your own data product; or creating a visualization of a complex dataset. Students are encouraged to work in teams of two or three for a project. Assignments, on the other hand, are to be completed and submitted individually. Besides the assignments and a project, there will be frequent opportunities for in-class exercises and "thought experiments". 

Grading 

Your final grade will be determined based on your performance on each of the following items; the percentages in parenthesis show the weight each item carries to the final grade. 

• Class participation (10%) 

Assignments (30%) 

• 

• 

Project (30%) 

• Final exam (30%) 

Letter grades: A (93--100%), A- (90--92.99%), B+ (87--89.99%), B (83--86.99%), B- (80--82.99%), C+ (77- -79.99%), C (70--76.99%), C- (67--69.99%), D (60--66.99%), F (less than 60%). Grading scale may be adjusted depending on class average.
