ELEC 378: Machine Learning: Concepts and Techniques 
Rice University 
Syllabus 
Spring 2023 
 
Overview 
 
This course deals with machine learning, from its theoretical mathematical foundations to 
practical implementation in computer algorithms for data science applications. The course 
follows a deterministic rather than probabilistic approach to focus on the key concepts; linear 
algebra plays a starring role.  
 
Goals 
 
At the conclusion of ELEC 378, you should have a solid understanding of 
• 
Machine learning concepts and theory 
• 
Machine learning algorithms for supervised and unsupervised tasks 
• 
The unifying role of linear algebra in machine learning 
• 
How these tools are used in real applications 
 
Prerequisites 
 
Open to students at all levels who are comfortable with 1) linear algebra and 2) coding in 
Python (ideally), R, MATLAB.  The ideal linear algebra preparation is via a course such as 
MATH/CAAM 335: Linear Algebra/Matrix Analysis.

Grading 
 
25%  - Midterm Exam  
25%  - Final Exam 
25%  - Homework 
25%  - Group Project 
Up to 3% bonus for outstanding class participation (see below) 
 
Study Groups 
 
Students will form formal study groups to discuss and work on the homework assignment 
together. We recommend that you meet as a group at least once per week. While group 
discussion of homework problems is highly encouraged, students must always submit their 
own work. Moreover, group work should not substitute for study on your own; at test time, only 
a pencil and a notes sheet will accompany you. 
 
Team Project Competition 
 
Students will organize into groups to conduct a team project that applies the concepts learned 
in the class. Teams will be mentored by an ECE grad student or postdoc researcher. The 
project will involve a competitive aspect using Kaggle; the grade on a competition project will 
be determined by (1) depth of exploration of the relevant concepts, and (2) quality of the 
competition report, (3) performance on the test data set. 
 
Class Participation 
 
Up to 3% bonus to your grade will be assessed based on (1) your attendance, (2) your 
participation in class, which includes posing and answering questions, (3) not using your laptop 
or smartphone during class, (4) completing group activities during class, (5) participating in 
office hours and Q/A sessions, and (6) finding errata in the course materials (see below). 
 
Homework Policy 
 
Homework will be posted each week on Piazza and is due by 5pm the following Friday. After 
the due date, 0% credit will be issued. However, ALL ASSIGNMENTS MUST BE COMPLETED 
AND TURNED IN, OR AN INCOMPLETE GRADE WILL BE ASSIGNED. Homework, tests, and 
solutions from previous offerings of this course are off limits, under the honor code. 
 
Errata 
 
You will receive a bonus in the class participation section of your course grade for sufficient 
contributions of errata to the course notes and CNX course text. Errata must be submitted on 
this google form: http://bit.ly/301errata 
 
Testing Policy 
 
Unless otherwise noted on the test instructions, all tests are timed (typically 3 hours), closed 
notes/books, and must be taken on your own (i.e., no collaboration with anyone else). Typically 
you will be allowed bring a hand-written note sheet to the exam. Homework, tests, and 
solutions from previous offerings of this course are off limits, under the honor code. 
 
Honor Code 
 
Homework, tests, and solutions from previous offerings of this course are off limits, under the 
honor code. 
 
Students with Disabilities 
 
Any student with a documented disability needing academic adjustments or accommodations 
is requested to speak with me during the first two weeks of class. All discussions will remain 
confidential. Students with disabilities should also contact Disabled Student Services in the 
Ley Student Center. 
 
Suggestions 
 
• 
Remember the big picture 
• 
Read the textbooks and reference materials and explore the connections 
• 
Learn linear algebra! 
• 
Prepare your own summaries from texts and notes 
• 
Work seriously in your study group for homework and studying; explain the main 
concepts to each other 
• 
This course is not about solving specific problems but about developing a problem-
solving process that you can apply to general problems
