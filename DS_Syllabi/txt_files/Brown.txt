DATA 1030 COURSE PROPOSAL SYLLABUS

FALL 2019

DATA SCIENCE INITIATIVE

INSTRUCTOR: ANDRAS ZSOM BROWN UNIVERSITY

INFORMATION

Course title: Hands-on Data Science. Meets TTh 13:00 to 14:20 in CIT 227.

COURSE

DESCRIPTION

Develops all aspects of the data science pipeline: data acquisition and cleaning, handling missing data, exploratory data analysis, visualization, feature engineering, modeling, interpretation, presentation in the context of real-world datasets. Fundamental considerations for data analysis are emphasized (the bias-variance tradeoff, training, validation, testing). Classical models and techniques for classification and regression are included (linear regression and logistic regression, support vector machines, decision trees, ensemble methods). Uses the Python data science ecosystem (numpy, pandas, matplotlib, plotly, scikit-learn).

This course equips students with the wide variety of general skills they will need to solve data science problems as a researcher or practitioner.

EXPECTATIONS

Students will be able to complete data science projects from the initial question to final presentation. Students will be able to acquire and clean data, explore the data visually, apply models, discuss the advantages and disadvantages of particular techniques, and interpret and present their findings.

Assessment in DATA 1030 is based on weekly homework assignments (including written and computational exercises, 20%), class participation (10%), two exams (25%), and one project (45%). The project will entail building machine learning pipeline which applies the ideas developed in the course to solve a real-world problem. Due dates for the midterm are as indicated in the schedule below and will be released with at least three weeks of lead time. Students will be evaluated on the basis of how effectively they implement the relevant models and discuss issues surrounding the application of machine learning to solve real-world problems.

This course will be based on notes produced for the course by the instructor. Recommended secondary sources include Python Data Science Handbook by Jake VanderPlas and Hands-on Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow by Aurélien Géron.

Students will meet three hours per week in class (42 total hours), and homework and other assignments will take about seven hours per week (98 hours). The project will take about 28 hours, and final exam review will take 12 hours, for a total of 180 hours.
