A “C-” will not be a qualifying grade for critical tracking courses. In order to graduate, students must have an 
overall GPA and an upper-division GPA of 2.0 or better (C or better).  Note: A “C-” average is equivalent to a GPA of 
1.67, and therefore, it does not satisfy this graduation requirement.
