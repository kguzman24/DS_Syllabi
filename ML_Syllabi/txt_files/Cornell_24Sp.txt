Course overview: The course provides an introduction to machine
learning, focusing on supervised learning and its theoretical
foundations. Topics include regularized linear models, boosting,
kernels, deep networks, generative models, online learning, and
ethical questions arising in ML applications.
Prerequisites: probability theory (e.g. BTRY 3080, ECON 3130,
MATH 4710, ENGRD 2700), linear algebra (e.g. MATH 2940), calculus
(e.g. MATH 1920), and programming proficiency (e.g. CS 2110).
Course logistics: For enrolled students the companion Canvas page serves as a hub for access to Ed Discussions (the
course forum), Vocareum (for course projects), Gradescope (for HWs), and paper comprehension quizzes. If you are
enrolled in the course you should automatically have access to the site. Please let us know if you are unable to access it.
Homework, projects, and exams
Your grade in this course is comprised of three components: homework, exams, and projects. Please also read through
the given references in concert with the lectures.
Homework:
There will be a number of homework assignments throughout the course, typically made available roughly one to
two weeks before the due date. The homework primarily focuses on theoretical aspects of the material and is
intended to provide preparation for the exams. Homework may be completed in groups of up to three. The
assignments themselves will be made available via Gradescope (through Canvas). You are allowed two slip days
per homework.
Projects
To provide hands on learning with the methods we will discuss in class there are a number of programming
projects throughout the course. The projects may be completed solo or in a group of two. They are accessed,
submitted, and graded using Vocareum. You are allowed two slip days per project.
Paper comprehension
Students enrolled in this course at the graduate level (i.e., enrolled in 5780) are required to read assigned
research papers and complete the associated online quiz. Papers will be assigned roughly once every two to three
weeks. You are allowed two slip days per quiz.
Exams:
There will be two exams for this class, an evening prelim and a final exam. The location and times for both are to
be determined.
Midterm exam: TBD
Final exam: TBD
Grading
Final grades are based on homework assignments, programming projects, and the exams. For the 5780 level version of
the course, the research comprehension quizzes will also factor in.
For CS 4780 your final grade consists of:
Exams: 48%
Homework: 15%
Projects: 37%
For CS 5780 your final grade consists of:
Exams: 45%
Homework: 10%
Projects: 35%
Paper comprehension: 10%
Undergraduates enrolled in 4780 may choose to do the paper comprehension assignments; if completed you will receive
the higher of your two grades between the above schemes.
Schedule
A tentative schedule follows, and includes the topics we will be covering, relevant reference material, and assignment
information. It is quite possible the specific topics covered on a given day will change slightly. This is particularly true
for the lectures in the latter part of the course, and this schedule will be updated as necessary. Please note that the
due dates here are mostly correct, but may change. Check Canvas for any changes to assignment due dates.

References
While this course does not explicitly follow a specific textbook, there are several that are very useful references to
supplement the course.
Books
We will not be explicitly following any single textbook in this course. Nevertheless, the book by Murphy roughly cover
the material for the course and is recommended. Most suggested readings are assigned out of these two texts. Three
additional texts are provided that complement these texts and are useful for further study (or to gain another
perspective).
Probabilistic Machine Learning: An Introduction, by Murphy
We will provide section numbers to this text alongside many of the lectures (abbreviated as PML in the schedule).
This text is available digitally through the Cornell University Library and a draft version is available directly from
the author. [Book website]
The Elements of Statistical Learning by Hastie, Tibshirani, and Friedman
This text provides a comprehensive introduction to statistical learning and provides in-depth discussion of many of
the topics in this course (abbreviated as ESL in the schedule). The book is available directly from the authors.
[Book website]
Additional references
An Introduction to Statistical Learning by James, Witten, Hastie, and Tibshirani
This book provides a good overview of some methods in statistical learning, some of which we will discuss. The
book is available online through the books website and via the Cornell Library. [Book website]
Patterns, Predictions, and Actions by Hardt and Recht
A very nice new book that covers many of the topics we do in this class (abbreviated as PPA in the schedule). The
book is available directly from the authors. [Book website]
Fairness and Machine Learning by Barocas, Hardt, and Narayanan
While a work in progress, this text provides insight into fairness as a central tenet of machine learning. In
particular, it highlights ethical challenges that arise in the practice of machine learning. The current version of this
book is available directly from the authors. [Book website]

Inclusiveness
You should expect and demand to be treated by your classmates and the course staff with respect. You belong here, and
we are here to help you learn and enjoy this course. If any incident occurs that challenges this commitment to a
supportive and inclusive environment, please let the instructors know so that the issue can be addressed. We are

Mental health resources
Cornell University provides a comprehensive set of mental health resources and the student group Body Positive
Cornell has put together a flyer outlined the resources available.
Participation
You are encouraged to actively participate in class. This can take the form of asking questions in class, responding to
questions to the class, and actively asking/answering questions on the online discussion board.
Collaboration policy
Students are free to share code and ideas within their stated project/homework group for a given assignment, but
should not discuss details about an assignment with individuals outside their group. The midterm and final exam are
individual assignments and must be completed by yourself.
Academic integrity
The Cornell Code of Academic Integrity applies to this course.
Accommodations
In compliance with the Cornell University policy and equal access laws, we are available to discuss appropriate
academic accommodations that may be required for student with disabilities. Requests for academic accommodations
are to be made during the first three weeks of the semester, except for unusual circumstances, so arrangements can be
made. Students are encouraged to register with Student Disability Services to verify their eligibility for appropriate
accommodations.
