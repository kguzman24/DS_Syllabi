Welcome to BIOL4800 section 3, Introduction to Data Science. We are living in a rapidly changing world, with the current pandemic as an immediate example among many other complex issues (e.g., climate warming, biodiversity loss). Meanwhile, increasing large volumes of data have become available during the past decades because of advances in technology, measurement approaches, establishment of citizen science programs, etc. This increasing wealth of data provides opportunities to solve complex problems that were unsolvable previously, fueling the rise of the new field of data science. Data science is interdisciplinary and usually combines elements of computer programming, statistics, graphic design, communication, and domain knowledge. A data scientist normally needs to identify relevant questions, gather appropriate data from different sources, clean, organize, and manage datasets, extract useful information to generate answers to the questions, and communicate results with 

others. 

This course will provide an introduction to data science by covering data science tools (e.g., command line, Git, etc.), basic to intermediate R programming, data management, data manipulation, data visualization, basic statistical models, and reproducible workflows to generate reports. This course 

will use R as the main programming language. However, the concepts and skills learned in this course will be easily transferable to other programming languages.

Syllabus | Introduction to Data Science 

This course will have lots of hands-on computing exercises during and after lectures. Therefore, students are strongly recommended to bring their own laptop to class. For students without access to a personal laptop, it is possible to check out one from the library (https://lib.lsu.edu/services/borrowing/gear) (https://lib.lsu.edu/services/borrowing/gear)). 

All softwares used in this course are free and cross platforms (macOS, Linux, or Windows operating systems). Main softwares that we will use are: Git (Git) (for version control), R (https://www.r-project.org) and use RStudio (https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/) as an integrated development environment (IDE). 

(#course-communications) 

Important notes about updates to the syllabus, clarifications of assignments, or changes to the schedule will be communicated via LSU email. Please be sure to check your account regularly. If you have an email that you would like to send to the entire class, please communicate with the course instructor before doing so. Short questions should be addreessed to me via email only after searching online and did not find an answer. I will try to respond to your email within 48 hours. More complicated questions should be addressed to me in person either after class or during office hours or appointment scheduled. In addition, we will use the Issues feature of GitHub to post questions and help each other. 

(#classroom-conduct) 

I will strive to create a learning environment for students that supports a diversity of thoughts, perspectives, and experiences, and honors your identities (including race, gender, class, sexuality, religion, nationality, ability, etc.). I welcome and appreciate any constructive criticisms, suggestions, ideas, 

comments, and any other feedbacks for the course.

I encourage all of us to use welcoming and inclusive language, show respect toward others, and acknowledge our differences. As a student, you should also strive to respect and honor the diversity of your classmates. If something was said/done in class (by anyone) that made you feel uncomfortable, please talk to 

me about it. 

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our community include: 

Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people 

Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences 

• Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback 

• 

Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes, and learning from the experience 

Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall 

community 

Examples of unacceptable behavior include: 

• The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of any kind 

Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks 

• Public or private harassment 

Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email address, without their explicit permission 

• Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

Note: If you believe you have been a victim of an alleged violation of the Code of Student Conduct (https://www.lsu.edu/saa/students/codeofconduct.php), or you are aware of such an alleged violation, you have the right to report it to the University (https://www.lsu.edu/saa/students/codeofconduct.php). 

→ (#expectations) 

LSU's general policy states that for each credit hour, you (the student) should plan to spend at least two hours working on course related activities outside of class. Since this course is for three credit hours, you should expect to spend a minimum of six hours outside of class each week working on assignments for 

this course. 

@ (#evaluation) 

Students will be evaluated on their knowledge of course content and ability to communicate their results via individual homework assignments (60%), their attendance and active participation in class (15%), and a final project (25%). 

Homework (60%) 

There will be 7 homework assignments, with 10 points for each assignment. All assignments should be finished as Rmarkdown files and I need to be able to 

reproduce all results by running it on my own computer. I expect that each student will complete the assignment independently (discussing about some questions is fine). The assignments are due by next Thursday before class. No late assignment will be accepted, for any reason. So don't wait until the last hour to do an assignment. Plan ahead and pace yourself. Instead of late 

assignment, I will drop your lowest score and use the other 6 scores for your final grade. At least 5 assignments must be turned in to achieve a passing grade.

Participation (15%) 

A key component of data science is communicating your results with others. It is thus critical to attend class and participate in discussing of concepts, results, etc. Another important reason to come to class is that it is easier for us to overcome the computational and programming burdles that you likely will encounter. Attendance and participation will be worth 15 points. 

Final project (25%) 

The final project will demonstrate your knowledge of the course content and beyond. It will be a full report in an R Makrdown format, mixed text with code, results, figures, tables, citations, etc. The final report should be in high quality and publishable with some additional effort later. The final project should be hosted on Github, organized as we discussed in class and should be fully reproducible. This means that I can clone your repository and re-run your files on my computer and get the same results. The final project deadline is December 3rd. More information about it can be found here (/). 

Grading 

LSU has a plus-minus grading scale. There will be no curve.

Louisiana State University adopted the Commitment to Community in 1995 to set forth guidelines for student behavior both inside and outside of the classroom. The Commitment to Community charges students to maintain high standards of academic and personal integrity. All students are expected to read 

and be familiar with the LSU Code of Student Conduct and Commitment to 

Community, found online at https://www.lsu.edu/saa/ (https://www.lsu.edu/saa/). It is your responsibility as a student at LSU to know and understand the academic standards for our community.

Students who are suspected of violating the Code of Conduct will be referred to 

the office of Student Advocacy & Accountability. For undergraduate students, a first academic violation could result in a zero grade on the assignment or failing the class and disciplinary probation until graduation. For a second academic violation, the result could be suspension from LSU. For graduate students, suspension is the appropriate outcome for the first offense. 

Further information is provided on the LSU website (https://www.lsu.edu/online/faculty/academicintegrity.php)
