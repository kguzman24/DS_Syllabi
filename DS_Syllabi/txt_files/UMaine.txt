Course Schedule: 

The table (next page) provides the initial distribution of topics discussed over the weeks in the semester. This schedule is tentative and subject to change during the semester at the instruction discretion. All changes will be announced in class or on the course website. Students are responsible for making sure they are informed about announcements. 

Details: 

• Homeworks: 

Homeworks will be assigned bi-weekly. The problems include statistical and proba bility concepts along with simple real-world problem solving. 

• Exams: 

You may use two cheat sheets (front and back), and no other materials are allowed. Please notify us the first week of class if you have a conflict. 

• Brightspace: 

Most questions you have about the course, both logistical and technical, should be posted to Brightspace. Questions about how to solve homework problems are encouraged, but responses should provide hints as opposed to detailed answers. You may indicate that your questions is for instructors only your question is of a sensitive nature or may disclose solutions to the class. 

• Standards of Conduct: 

Please, 

Arrive to class on time. If you must enter a class after lecture has clearly begun, please do so quietly. Focus on class material during class time. Sleeping, doing work for another class, checking email, and exploring the internet are unacceptable and can be disruptive. Only use personal electronic devices during class for viewing or

taking notes. If you elect to use a laptop during class, please type very quietly. Few things are more annoying than sitting next to someone who is pounding on their keyboard during a lecture. Refrain from eating during class. Avoid audible and visible signs of restlessness. These are both rude and disruptive to the rest of the class. Don’t pack your bags to leave until the instructor has dismissed class. Thank you. 

• Collaboration on homeworks: 

Each student will prepare the final write-up of his or her homework solutions without 3

reference to any other person or source, aside from the student’s own notes or scrap work. Students may consult classmates for the purpose of brainstorming, but not for obtaining the details of solutions. Under no circumstances may you copy solutions or code from a classmate or other source. 

Campus Policies: 

• Academic Honesty Statement: 

Academic honesty is very important. It is dishonest to cheat on exams, to copy term papers, to submit papers written by another person, to fake experimental results, or to copy or reword parts of books or articles into your own papers without appropriately citing the source. Students committing or aiding in any of these violations may be given failing grades for an assignment or for an entire course, at the discretion of the instructor. In addition to any academic action taken by an instructor, these violations are also subject to action under the University of Maine Student Conduct Code. The maximum possible sanction under the student conduct code is dismissal from the University. 

• Students Accessibility Services Statement: 

If you have a disability for which you may be requesting an accommodation, please contact Student Accessibility Services, 121 East Annex, 581.2319, as early as pos sible in the term. Students who have already been approved for accommodations by SAS and have a current accommodation letter should meet with me privately during the first two weeks of class. All discussions will remain confidential. 

• Course Schedule Disclaimer (Disruption Clause): 

In the event of an extended disruption of normal classroom activities, the format for this course may be modified to enable its completion within its programmed time frame. In that event, you will be provided an addendum to the syllabus that will supersede this version.

• UMaine Student Code of Conduct: 

All students are expected to conform to the UMaine Student Code of Conduct. https://www.maine.edu/board-of-trustees/policy-manual/section-501/ 

• Observance of Religious Holidays/Events: 

The University of Maine recognizes that when students are observing significant re ligious holidays, some may be unable to attend classes or labs, study, take tests, or work on other assignments. If they provide adequate notice (at least one week and longer if at all possible), these students are allowed to make up course requirements as long as this effort does not create an unreasonable burden upon the instruc tor, department or University. At the discretion of the instructor, such coursework could be due before or after the examination or assignment. No adverse or preju dicial effects shall result to a student’s grade for the examination, study, or course requirement on the day of religious observance. The student shall not be marked absent from the class due to observing a significant religious holiday. In the case of an internship or clinical, students should refer to the applicable policy in place by the employer or site.
