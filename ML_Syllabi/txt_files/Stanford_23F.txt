All lecture videos can be accessed through Canvas.
Advice on applying machine learning: Slides from Andrew Ng's lecture on getting machine learning algorithms to work in practice can be found here.
Previous projects: Projects from previous years can be found in the “Final Projects” doc on the home page.
Data: Here is the UCI Machine learning repository, which contains a large collection of standard datasets for testing learning algorithms. If you want to see examples of recent work in machine learning, 
start by taking a look at the conferences NeurIPS (all old NeurIPS papers are online) and ICML. Some other related conferences include UAI, AAAI, IJCAI.
Viewing PostScript and PDF files: Depending on the computer you are using, you may be able to download a PostScript viewer or PDF viewer for it if you don't already have one.
Machine learning study guides tailored to CS 229 by Afshine Amidi and Shervine Amidi.
The Matrix Cookbook: Quick reference for matrix identities, approximations, relations, etc.
