Narrative 
We've been teaching independent study courses on this subject, and we have 
the resources to put it in our regular course rotation. The CS group offers a 
rotating selection of 6-7 upper division electives each semester, according to 
faculty availability, and this course will be slotted into that selection of 
electives. 
Justification for Proposal 
Machine learning is becoming a very important topic in computer science and 
we need a course that addresses this. It is also the case that machine learning 
is a part of data science and the statistics professors have requested the 
computer science faculty create this course.

Description: 
Machine learning is the ability of computers to learn without explicitly 
programming an algorithm. Machine learning techniques learn about hyper-
dimensional spaces with either explicit direction or implicit reinforcement. This 
course covers a variety of machine learning techniques and their application to 
actual data. Topics include the clustering of data and the retrieval of related 
data, the use of machine learning for recommender systems, and the creation 
of deep learning systems. This course includes both the underlying theory of 
machine learning and the creation of machine learning software for real-world 
problems.

Learning Objectives: 
1. 
Evaluate and choose an appropriate machine learning technique for a 
given problem. 
2. 
Analyze how a neural network model is represented and how it 
encodes non-linear features.    
3. 
Select appropriate neural networks and deep learning for differing 
problems. 
4. 
Create and analyze models that reflect real-world data. 
5. 
Perform back propagation for a neural network. 
6. 
Assess how hidden layers contribute to a neural network’s capabilities. 
7. 
Compare supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning. 
8. 
Construct a recommender system. 
9. 
Uncover hidden patterns and structures in data with clustering.
