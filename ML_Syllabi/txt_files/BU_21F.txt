CSE4/574: Introduction to Machine Learning
Fall 2021
Instructor: Mingchen Gao
Syllabus
Machine learning is concerned with the question of how to make computers learn from experience. The
ability to learn is not only central to most aspects of intelligent behavior, but machine learning techniques
have become key components of many software systems. For examples, machine learning techniques are
used to create spam ﬁlters, to analyze customer purchase data, to understand natural language, or to detect
fraudulent credit card transactions.
This course will introduce the fundamental set of techniques and algorithms that constitute machine
learning as of today, ranging from classiﬁcation methods like decision trees, support vector machines and
neural networks, over structured models like hidden Markov models, to clustering and matrix factorization
methods for recommendation. The course will not only discuss individual algorithms and methods, but also
tie principles and approaches together from a theoretical perspective, as well as the gaining fundamentals
of applying machine learning techniques to real-world problems. In particular, the course will cover the
following topics:
Generative Models, Bayesian Learning, Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Perceptron, Neural Net-
works, Convolutional Neural Network, Recurrent Neural Network, Reinforcement Learning, Graphical Mod-
els, Clustering, Latent Linear Models, Support Vector Machines, Decision Tree, Boosting, Random Forest,
Hidden Markov Models.
The prerequisites of CSE4/574 are Linear Algebra, Probability, and Statistics.
We are going to use
Python for the programing assignments.

Accessibility Services and Special Needs
If you have a disability and may require some type of instructional and/or examination accommoda-
tion, please inform me early in the semester so that we can coordinate the accommodations you may
need. If you have not already done so, please contact the Oﬃce of Accessibility Services; 25 Capen Hall;
email: stu-accessibility@buﬀalo.edu Phone: 716-645-2608 (voice); 716-645-2616 (TTY); and on the web at
http://www.student-aﬀairs.buﬀalo.edu/ods/. All information and documentation is conﬁdential.
The University at Buﬀalo and the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences are committed to ensuring
equal opportunity for persons with special needs to participate in and beneﬁt from all of its programs,
services and activities.
Academic Integrity
This course will operate with a zero-tolerance policy regarding cheating and other forms of academic dishon-
esty. Any act of academic dishonesty will subject the student to penalty, including the high probability of
failure of the course (i.e., assignment of a grade of F). It is expected that you will behave in an honorable and
respectful way as you learn and share ideas. Therefore, recycled papers, work submitted to other courses,
and major assistance in preparation of assignments without identifying and acknowledging such assistance
are not acceptable. All work for this course must be original for this course. Please familiar yourself with
the CSE Departments’ and University at Buﬀalo’s Academic Integrity Policy and Procedure outlined at
http://www.cse.buffalo.edu/shared/policies/academic.php.
